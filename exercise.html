<h1><u>22 Moves to Make the Most of Your At-Home Workout
</h1></u>
<p>If the idea of a home workout makes you yawn, think again!
When executed correctly, using just your body weight can give you a run for your money.<br>
So, whether the gym isn’t your thing or you’re short on time, clear out a space in the living room and prepare to sweat.<br>
The 22 bodyweight moves we’ve detailed below can be scaled for beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercisers, so start where you feel ready and progress from there.</p>
<h2>Beginner routine
</h2>
<p>Our six picks for beginner bodyweight exercises will provide a full-body workout.
Complete 2 sets of 10 to 15 reps of each exercise, with 30 seconds to 1 minute of rest between each move.<br>
This circuit should take about 15-20 minutes — a great beginner routine.
</p>
<h1>Bridge</h1>
<img src="f2.gif">
<p>Activate your core and posterior chain (a fancy term for the backside of your body) with a bridge. This is a great exercise to use as a warmup.<br>
Directions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and your arms extended by your sides.
<li>Pushing through your feet and bracing your core, raise your bottom off the ground until your hips are fully extended, squeezing your glutes at the top.
<li>Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.
</ul>
</p>
<h1>Chair squat</h1>
<img src="f3.gif">
<p>Squat to strengthen your legs and core, which will make everyday movements easier. Starting with a chair underneath you will help you master proper form.<br>

Directions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Stand in front of the chair with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointed slightly out.
<li>Hinging at your hips and bending your knees, lower back and down until your bottom touches the chair, allowing your arms to extend out in front of you.
<li>Push up through your heels and return to the starting position.
</ul></p>
<h1>Stationary lunge</h1>
<img src="f5.gif">
<p>Hit your quads, hamstrings, and glutes with a stationary lunge.<br>
Directions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Split your stance with your right leg in front. Your right foot should be flat on the ground, and your left foot should be up on its toes.
<li>Bend your knees and lunge, stopping when your right thigh is parallel to the ground.
<li>Push up through your right foot to return to the starting position. Repeat for desired number of reps, then switch legs.
</ul></p>
<h1>Plank to Downward Dog</h1>
<img src="f6.gif">
<p>This move will test your upper body, especially your shoulders. Who says you need weights for a shoulder workout?<br>
Directions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Get into a high plank position, with your hands stacked underneath your shoulders and your feet close together.
<li>Keeping your core engaged and your hands and feet stationary, pike your hips up and back into the Downward Dog pose. Your body should form a triangle with the ground. Keep your neck neutral. Your gaze should be directed toward your feet.
<li>Hold here for a second, then return to the plank. Repeat.
Straight-leg donkey kick
</ul></p>
<h1>Forearm plank</h1>
<img src="f7.gif">
<p>A full-body exercise that requires strength and balance, planks put the core into overdrive.<br>

Directions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Assume a plank position on your forearms. Your body should form a straight line from head to feet.
<li>Ensure your lower back and hips don’t sag. Hold the position for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
</ul></p>
<h1>Bicycle crunch</h1>
<img src="f8.gif">
<p>Although you’ll work your core with almost all of these strength exercises, a targeted ab move doesn’t hurt.
<br>
Directions:<br>
<ul>
<li>Lie on your back and bring your legs to a tabletop position. Bend your elbows, and put your hands behind your head.
<li>Crunch up and bring your right elbow to your left knee, straightening your right leg.
<li>Release the crunch slightly. Bend your right leg and straighten your left leg, then bring your left elbow to your right knee.
<li>Repeat for the desired number of reps.
</ul></p>
<h2>Intermediate routine</h2>
<p>If you’ve mastered the beginner routine, you’re ready to take on these intermediate moves.<br>

Complete 2 sets of 10 to 15 reps of each exercise below, then move on to the next after 1 minute of rest.<br>

An alternative, more advanced approach is to complete timed rounds. For instance, complete 1 minute of each exercise and repeat the circuit twice.<br>

Compete against yourself to get just 1 or 2 more reps each time you complete the routine.</p>
<h1>
Single-leg bridge</h1><p>
Any time you take an exercise to a single leg, you’ll automatically make it harder.

Here, follow the steps for a bridge, but lift one foot off the ground while keeping your leg bent for an intermediate challenge.

Complete the same number of reps on each side.
<h1>
Squat
<p>Taking out the chair allows you to master the form of a regular bodyweight squat.

The same motion is still applicable here, though. Imagine you’re sitting down in a chair by hinging at the hips and pushing your bottom back.
<h1>
Pushup<p>
A standard pushup is the more challenging version of a knee pushup. Assume a high plank position and complete the pushup in the same way, allowing your elbows to flare out at a 45-degree angle.
<h1>
Walking lunge<p>
By traveling instead of staying stationary in a lunge, you’ll add aspects of stability, mobility, and balance.
Start with your feet together and step forward, lunging with your right leg. Stand up, then repeat with your left leg.
<h1>
Pike pushups<p>
Adding a pushup to your pike will target those shoulders even more. The movement here is all in the arms, so keep the rest of your body stable.

To perform, assume a pike position and bend at the elbows — allowing them to flare out to the sides — directing the top of your head toward the ground.
<h1>
Plank with alternating leg lift<p>
Adding a leg lift to a regular plank makes you unstable, requiring your core to work in overdrive and your three limbs to support more weight.

Lift one leg up, hold for 5 seconds, and return it to the ground. Repeat with the other leg.
<h1>Kneeling side plank with hip abduction<p>
Holding your body up with your knee and your extended arm during a hip abduction makes this move an upper body exercise, too. Plus, it recruits the core even more.

To perform, assume a kneeling side plank, then lift the free leg up, pause, and lower it back down. Repeat on both sides.

<h2>Advanced routine</h2><p>
When the intermediate routine becomes a breeze, take a stab at these advanced moves.</p>

<h1>Bridge with leg extended<p>
Lifting the foot then extending the leg straight out will make a single-leg bridge even more difficult.

Keep your foot flexed throughout the movement. Complete the same number of reps on both legs.
<h1>
Overhead squat<p>
Extending your arms overhead will challenge your mobility and range of motion in your upper body, as well as give your lower body the benefits of a squat.

To perform, complete a squat with your arms extended overhead throughout.
<h1>
One-legged pushup<p>
Lifting one leg will again put more weight into your other three limbs, thus creating more of a challenge.

To get it done, assume a pushup position and lift one leg off the ground, then complete the pushup.
<h1>
Jumping lunges<p>
Jumping exercises — often known as plyometrics — require you to give it your max effort for a short interval of time.

Because of the power and strength they require, you’ll feel the burn quickly.

Add a jump to your lunge, really exploding up in each rep, to challenge yourself.
<h1>
Elevated pike pushups<p>
Elevating your feet in a pike pushup will make this version the hardest.

Put your feet on an elevated surface, like a bench or a step, and complete an elevated pike pushup.

The higher the surface, the more challenging it will be.
<h1>
Get-up squat with jump<p>
Instead of stepping your feet back up from kneeling, jump them. You’ll need lots of power and strength for this move.
<h1>
Advanced Bird Dog<p>
Get into a high plank position, then complete a Bird Dog, lifting one arm and the opposite leg simultaneously.

As with all advanced exercises, maintaining a straight spine is key here.
<h1>
One-leg or one-arm plank<p>
Lifting one arm or one leg — and holding it there — will take a plank up a notch. Hold for as many seconds as you can, then switch sides.

One leg will be more challenging than one arm, so choose the right version for you.
<h1>
Side plank with hip abduction<p>
Plank off your foot instead of your knee for a full-body challenge in this hip abduction.
To perform, assume a side plank, then perform a leg lift. Repeat on both sides.
